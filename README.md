This the prototype for the AVATAR UX test project. I wanted to add more detail here about my decisions and thought process.

After some research, I decided to go with the route of adding different probabilities for each symbol for each of the 5 reels.

There are 7 win lines I decided to go with(taking into consideration a win can be 3 >= symbols):
* All of the 3 rows
* Diagonal 1 : [0, 0], [1, 1], [2, 2], [1, 3], [0, 4]
* Diagonal 2 : [2, 0], [1, 1], [0, 2], [1, 3], [2, 4]
* Diagonal 3 : [0, 0], [1, 1], [2, 2], [2, 3], [2, 4]
* Diagonal 4 : [2, 0], [1, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [0, 4]

I could've added many more diagonals that can be considered classic but I wanted to keep it simple.
I also searched on how to calculate the RTP in general and I included another file, named RPTCalc and it seems the RPT for my chosen values is around 92%, which is inside the values of 85% and 98% that are needed for a legal slot machine. However, I am not sure for what amount of time is the player supposed to earn that amount back if he spends enough. I think it
was worthwhile to check some RTP calculus because before the value with my random values inserted was around 2-5% which is bad.

Thank you for considering my application,
